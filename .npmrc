# Limits the maximum length of directory names created inside pnpm's virtual store.
#
# pnpm uses a "virtual store" (node_modules/.pnpm) that encodes package metadata into
# folder names; on Windows this can hit path-length limits. Lowering this value helps
# keep paths shorter and reduces install failures due to long paths.
#
# Value: integer (characters)
# Example: 60
virtual-store-dir-max-length=60
